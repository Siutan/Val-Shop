##Features:

##Build your own
###what you'll need
- Node v16.x
- npm v6.x or above
- Expo cli `npm install -g expo-cli` (if you run `yarn start` yarn will install the cli)
- Expo app on your phone (for testing on device, emulators are fine too)

###Get started
I used yarn throughout this project but npm should work too.

Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install dependencies.

Then run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the development server

###Building the app
You can use expo to build the app and publish it to the app or play store.
There is a wait time when you do this as it goes through Expo's AWS servers (around 15-20 minutes).
If you'd like to do this locally, refer to [this guide.](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/building-standalone-apps.html)

Run `expo build:android` to build the app for android.

Run `expo build:ios` to build the app for IOS.

Follow [this guide](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/building-standalone-apps.html) to build the app for both platforms.

Follow [this guide.](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/publishing-to-the-app-store.html) to publish to the app store.
